## Challenge 10

Challenge 10 is a 32 bit Linux ELF and has anti-debugging protection for
*some* of the processes. Due to some bad assumptions on my end, I ended up with
some really hacky ways to get through part 2 and 3.

1. [Part 1a](part1a.md) - Adding structs in IDA Pro
2. [Part 1b](part1b.md) - Patching library calls in Radare2
3. [Part 2](part2.md) - Patching in Radare2 to print dynamically-generated
   data
4. [Part 3](part3.md) - Debugging parts of shellcode in x32dbg
