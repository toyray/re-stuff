# Background
This is a collection of scripts to solve the password for a simple crackme **IOLI Crackme 0x02** from [GitHub/Maijin/Workshop2015/IOLI-crackme](https://github.com/Maijin/Workshop2015/tree/master/IOLI-crackme).

As there are Linux (x86), Windows (x86) and PocketPC (ARM) versions of the same crackme, this is a great excuse to try out different tools :wink: and build a personal reference for automating similar RE tasks in the future.

# Static Disassembly

The important bits of the crackme are shown below. The password generation algorithm is identical for all three platforms and can be solved manually from the disassembly but what's the fun in that? :grin:

## Linux

![Disassembly of important bits](img/linux-disasm.png)

The entered password is read via *scanf()* at *0x08048426* and stored in **var_4h** as an integer. It must match the value in **eax** at *0x08048448* which is calculated by a few mathematical operations between *0x0804842B* and *0x8048444*.

## PocketPC (ARM)

![Disassembly of important bits](img/arm-disasm.png)

The entered password is read via *scanf()* at *0x00011080* and stored in **var_18h** as an integer. It must match the value in **r3** at *0x000110b8* which is calculated by a few mathematical operations between *0x00011084* and *0x000110b0*.

## Windows

![Disassembly of important bits](img/win-disasm.png)

The entered password is read via *scanf()* at *0x00401360* and stored in **var_4h** as an integer. It must match the value in **eax** at *0x00401382* which is calculated by a few mathematical operations between *0x00401365* and *0x0040137e*.
